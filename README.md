# Loan Data Analysis

## Introduction
This report provides a detailed analysis of loan data through various visualizations. The goal is to uncover insights regarding loan approvals, demographic factors, and financial behaviors.

## Data Overview
- Loan data is the information collected by financial institutions when people apply for loans. It contains various details about the applicants, their financial situation, and whether their loan applications were approved or not. This data helps banks and lenders assess whether they should approve a loan and under what conditions. It also helps them understand trends, predict loan repayment behavior, and manage risks.
